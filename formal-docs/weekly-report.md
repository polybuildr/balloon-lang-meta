# Week 1: 12th - 19th Jan

- Looked into Scala's type system
    - https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/type-basics.html
    - Part of https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/advanced-types.html
    - Went through some basic tutorials at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/ 
- Read about subtype polymorphism, parametric polymorphism, covariance and contravariance (especially in function calls), and row polymorphism
- Looked at Typed Racket
- Looked at Racket's syntax extensions
- Read about Nim, a new (2008) "statically typed, imperative programming language that tries to give the programmer ultimate power without compromises on runtime efficiency." since an article said that it combines features of C/C++, Rust, Python and Go.
- Looked at sum types (tagged variants) and union types (Typescript's need to model existing JS libs)
- Looked at Jeremy Siek and Walid Taha's paper: Gradual Typing for Objects
- Looked at Sam Tobin-Hochstadt Matthias Felleisen's paper: The Design and Implementation of Typed Scheme
- Started reading the under-development book "Crafting Interpreters" (craftinginterpreters.com) by Bob Nystrom, a language designer and engineer currently working on Dart at Google. He has built several small languages: https://github.com/munificent
- [IRC] Joined a programming language design IRC channel which has many enthusiasts that have built their own programming languages, some of which are impressive
- Got a gentle introduction to Typeclasses in the Haskell context
- [IRC] Was pointed to a "Programming Languages Zoo" (https://github.com/andrejbauer/plzoo) with examples of tiny languages, each with different language features (functional, declarative, object-oriented, and procedural languages, for example)
- [IRC] Got an explanation for why normal subtyping makes type inference difficult
- [IRC] Was pointed to Google's Dart, since it seems to share many goals

# Week 2: 19th Jan - 24th Jan

- Looked at Dart language, since it shares many common goals
- Attempted to understand details of Jeremy Siek's paper on gradual typing for objects
- Learnt that there was a difference between optional and gradual typing
- A week long vacation started on the 24th

# Week 3: 1st Feb - 8th Feb

- Considered and decided some semantics of the language
    - Basic syntax (without OOP considerations)
    - Handling of immutability: asked certain questions on IRC channel and StackOverflow: have some tentative decisions
- Ran a basic analysis on jQuery's code to look for a particular assignment pattern
- Read (and understood more of) Siek's paper
- Found an LLVM Kaleidoscope tutorial in Rust for reference: https://github.com/jauhien/iron-kaleidoscope
- Reconsidered Rust vs C++ for implementation.
    - With some assurance of help with the trickier parts of Rust, will tentatively go with Rust.
- Found and read Siek's analysis of gradual typing in TypeScript
    - [Part 1](siek.blogspot.in/2012/10/is-typescript-gradually-typed-part-1.html), [Part 2](siek.blogspot.in/2012/10/is-typescript-gradually-typed-part-2.html)
    - Discusses type 1, type 2, and type 3 gradual typing
    - Raises some issues in TypeScript, a TypeScript team member responds
    - For type 3 typing, will need to look at a follow up paper by Siek on blaming

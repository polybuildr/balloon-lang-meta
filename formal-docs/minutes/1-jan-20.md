# Agenda
- Discuss work done in preceding week
- Briefly discuss papers that Vivek looked at, and decide importance of them, as well as ask for any additional relevant papers
- Discuss tentative plan for next week
- Change of plans: Going for another experimental week
- Learn concepts by talking to people on programming language design IRC channel
- Read implementations of various languages in the "Programming Language Zoo"
- Read about Google's Dart language, since it turns out to share many goals
- Ask for suggestions on additional reading to be done in following week

# Minutes
- Ran through some things done in preceding week
    - Mentioned papers
    - Mentioned IRC channel, and certain problems discussed in it, such as subtyping making type inference difficult
- Types in Programming Languages: Benjamin Pierce
    - Got the PDF version of the book
- ~ Wadler (2nd author): Java's type system: Dynamic checks
    - Book on Java's types
- Cyclone: A Type-Safe Dialect of C - UMD
    - Language that inspired Rust, more type safety than normal C, in a very C-like language
- Generate proofs to help programmer when type errors occur
    - ~ OOPSLA: Samsung: Interface to existing languages, proofs for type errors
- Consider smaller type systems: integers only, with proofs, usable as libraries

# Takeaway + plan for next week
- **(NOTE) Will not be available for most of the week. So this plan is probably for about 2 weeks.**
- Need to read more, list down breadth of topics, and then scope type system (at least tentatively)
- Will look at the Programming Langauge Zoo to learn more about different kinds of languages
- Skim through Pierce's books on type systems
- Skim through Wadler's book on Java's type system
- Read about Google's Dart language, including possible papers on the language's philosophy
- Try to decide on the type system, at least do some scoping

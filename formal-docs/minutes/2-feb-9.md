# Agenda

- Discuss some parts of language design
  - Level 1 or 2 gradual typing (Siek's classification)
  - `var`, `val` like Scala
  - OOP: some details to be figured out later
  - "Everything is an object" paradigm; primitives?
  - First class functions, `fn`
- Start implementation
  - Will start with Rust
  - Start with variable declarations, basic binary ops
  - Functions and closures
  - OOP in next stage
- Resources while implementing
  - Siek and Taha's: Gradual typing for objects
  - Microsoft Research: Gavin and Abadi's: Understanding typescript
  - Bob Nystrom's "Crafting interpreters" book code: jlox
  - Suggestion for resources, while implementing?

# Agenda
- Introduce the project: goals, etc.
- Decide on meeting format and time
Pl- an tasks for first week

# Minutes
- Vivek introduced project meta repository: https://github.com/polybuildr/balloon-lang-meta
	- includes working draft of goals, goals under consideration and non-goals
	- includes questions that need to be resolved
- Vivek discussed goals of the language
	- Gradually typed (easy prototyping, safer production code, increased developer productivity), has mutable state (easier to work with when coming from other web back-end languages)
	- Primary audience: back-end web developers, hence should be familiar to them
	- Free of cruft from backwards compatibility issues
- Prof. Choppella spoke about other languages that achieve said goals, and are interesting to look at and learn from
	- Scala
	- F*
	- OCaml, ML and family
	- Typed Racket
- Prof. Choppella suggested things to look into for the next week:
	- Scala's type system
	- Look at OCaml
	- Consider (Typed) Racket's syntax extensions to implement the interpreter for the language
# Tentative topics to cover
- Scala's type system
- Look at other languages implementing mutability and gradual typing (or type inference)
- Papers on gradual typing
- Wikipedia's pages on "Comparison of Programming Languages by <>"
- Typed Racket and syntax extensions

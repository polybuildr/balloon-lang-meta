# Agenda

- Discuss currently implemented constructs (../, demo the interpreter and typechecker
- Discuss next few things planned (too many, too little time):
  - Type inference/propagation and subsequent checking is messy at function boundaries, support gradual typing there
  - Member access by `.identifier` syntax
  - Member functions, `tuple.len()`, `string.as_bytes()`
  - Change type of values to `Gc<GcCell<Value>>` allowing for referenes and mutable data structures
- Discuss evaluation of project and artifacts to be presented at final evaluation
